Identify tokens with significant utility or strong development teams but low market capitalization.

## Use Valuation Metrics

- Network Activity: High active addresses or transaction volume relative to market cap.
- Development Progress: Assess roadmap milestones and active repositories on platforms like GitHub.

## Analyze Market Sentiment

- Low Analyst Coverage: Underfollowed stocks may be mispriced.
- High Short Interest: Contrarian investors may see opportunity in oversold assets.
- Fear in the Market: Assets in sectors experiencing panic selling could be undervalued.

## Use Tools and Screeners

- CoinGecko
- Glassnode
- CoinMarketCap

## Conduct a Fundamental Analysis

- Examine financial health, revenue growth, and profitability.
- Assess management quality, competitive position, and long-term prospects.
- Look for temporary challenges that may be suppressing the asset’s price but don’t affect its long-term value.

## Watch for Catalysts

Look for upcoming events that could increase an asset's perceived value, such as:

- New product launches.
- Regulatory approvals.
- Market expansion announcements.

## Evaluate Risks

- Identify reasons why the asset might be undervalued (e.g., macroeconomic concerns, sector trends, company-specific
  issues).
- Assess whether the market has overreacted to these factors.
